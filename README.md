## About Me
I am a second semester MA Data and Discourse studies student, while completing an intensive Data Analytics bootcamp at Ironhack Berlin, where I'm learning to work with real datasets to extract insights and assist final decision-making. So far, I enjoy deriving meanings from code syntaxes and translating them into everyday language, while learning to turn raw data into clear insights that could tell comprehensible business stories.
